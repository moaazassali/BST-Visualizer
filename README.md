# BST Visualizer

Welcome!

This is a visualization app of the binary search tree data structures. You can visit it here (https://moaazassali.github.io/BST-Visualizer/).

Simply start by adding any value from 0 to 9,999 and the path taken towards inserting that node will be shown. A green light indicates a greater value so it moves right. On the other hand, a red light indicates a lower value so it moves left.
