# BST Visualizer

Welcome!
This application is a visualization of the binary search tree data structure.

You can insert any value from 0 to 9,999 and the application will show the logic behind inserting the nodes. A green light indicates a higher value and therefore it moves to the right. On the other hand, a red light indicates a lower value and then moves to thr left.
